/*The Story: A local theme park has a ride where 
the rider must be at least 42 inches tall to ride and is over the age of 10.
 They've hired the development agency you work at to build an app
  where once it measures a rider's height and age, can display whether the rider
   is tall enough and old enough to ride the rollercoaster.
    You've been tasked with building the variables for this app.



Step 3: In your same VS Code file, use comments to explain 
what the variables must be set to in order for the rider to ride.

var height = 0;     //should be at least 42 inches
var age = 0;        //should be over 10 years
